<!--NOTES:
    Use <p> and <div> too write blocks of text
    However, it is preferred to use <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <figure> where possible because they have a more semantic meaning
    There is also <article>, <aside>, <section>, <maim>, ...
    <hr> puts a horizontal line that extends across the screen
    If there is an address in the webpage, put it in the <address> block tag cuz screen readers will directly find the address this way
    The <details> is used with <summary> to show a drop down detail when clicked on the summary, this is not supported by firefox yet
    These tags above are all block tags. Remember inline tags can flow next to each other and don't cause a line break before and after the element. We have seen this with links and images
    Here are some inline tags: 
    1. The <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work like book movie etc and makes it italic
    2. The <abbr> tag will show text when u hover over a specific word or text
    3. In the <code> tag, u put msln an example of code and it will show in a different manner
    4. using <sub> and <sup> fina ndif 2us msln aw hamesh
    inline tags that need some knowledge and javascript to make them work how the coder wants exactly:
    <button> which literally shows a button
    <meter> shows a bar that we can fill to a specific point
    <progress> also shows a bar that can be filled dynamically according to a specific event
    <iframe> used to display a webpage within a webpage and it shows content dynamically according to width and height
